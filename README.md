Applicant Tracking Systems Design

A companyâ€™s hiring process plays a major role in its future success. Traditional hiring process still seems to be time consuming, messy, and frustrating for both the company and the applicants.
HR team have been struggling to keep up with job posts, applicants, resumes, interviews, and boarding process. 
The traditional hiring process requires Human Resource groups or recruiters to manually type and process the hiring data.
The Applicant Tracking System (ATS) helps to parse the resumes of applicants and breakdown the data, integrate job postings with different job boards, with better user interface and visualization of the hiring process.
